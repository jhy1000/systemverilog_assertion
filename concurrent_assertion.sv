/*
When you look at examples of concurrent assertions, you'll see |-> and  |=> operators frequently used. 
Thess are called implication operators and the LHS of the operator is called the antecedent and the RHS is called the consequent.

|->: Overlapping implication - The RHS is evaluated from the same cycle LHS is true
|=>: Non-overlapping implication - The RHS is evaluated one cycle after LHS is true
